# Auxiliary Material
This repository contains auxiliary material for the EMMSAD 2020 (full paper) and SAC 2020 (poster) submissions titled
- EMMSAD 2020 (full paper): **Model-driven Development of Microservice Architecture: An Experiment on the Quality in Use of a UML- and a DSL-based Approach**.
- SAC 2020 (poster):  **Modeling Microservice Architecture: a Comparative Experiment Towards the Effectiveness of Two Approaches**

The following material is presented.

 - **Anonymized version of LEMMA source code**
We prepared an [anonymized version of the LEMMA source code](lemma) in the folder of the same name. We used this version for conducting the experiment. Please understand that we are not able to provide the normal precompiled releases in this version. Detailed instruction on how to install the sources is given in the [readme.md](lemma/readme.md). For precompiled sources and the latest stable release of LEMMA can be found in its  [official repository](https://github.com/SeelabFhdo/lemma).
- **Data Set**
The [data set](prepared_data_set.csv) is available as a .csv file including the data from the questionnaire and the detected numbers of errors during the review of the submitted models from the student assignment.
- **Scenario Description**
A translated version of the [scenario description](Task_Desc_Version_A.pdf) our students received as the assignment during the experiment. Please note that the file is a translation of version A whereby version B simply had an inverse order of the tasks.
